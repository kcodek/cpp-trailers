#### STL
> create a table form for insert, delete operations for all the containers
insertion into containers - multiple ways 
- list :
    - insertion: push_back, push_front, insert
    - deletion : erase,remove, remove_if
    - iteration & display


- set:
    - change the default sorting, compartor

- map


- deque

- vector
    - storing custom datatype 
    - storing pointers
    - deleting elements
    
- rope

#### Strings


#### Streams


#### File Handling


#### Parsing - JSON, XML, text, csv


#### Smart pointers


#### Error Handling & Exceptions


#### Concurrency
